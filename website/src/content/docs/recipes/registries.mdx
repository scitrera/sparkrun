description: Configure custom recipe registries for sharing and discovering recipes.
---

sparkrun searches bundled recipes first, then any custom registries you've configured. Registries are git repositories containing YAML recipe files.

## Spark Arena

[Spark Arena](https://spark-arena.com) is the community recipe hub for DGX Spark. It is included as a default registry — recipes from Spark Arena appear automatically in `sparkrun list` and `sparkrun search`.

You can also run Spark Arena recipes directly using the `@spark-arena/` shortcut:

```bash
# Run a Spark Arena recipe by its ID
sparkrun run @spark-arena/<recipe-id>

# Inspect with VRAM estimation
sparkrun show @spark-arena/<recipe-id>

# Save a local copy for customization
sparkrun show @spark-arena/<recipe-id> --save my-recipe.yaml
```

Visit [spark-arena.com](https://spark-arena.com) to browse the full catalog, view benchmark results, and copy recipe links.

## View configured registries

```bash
sparkrun registry list
```

## Add a registry

```bash
sparkrun registry add https://github.com/myorg/spark-recipes.git
```

The repository will be cloned using a sparse checkout for efficiency. If recipes live in a subdirectory, they will be discovered automatically.

## Remove a registry

```bash
sparkrun registry remove myteam
```

## Enable/Disable registries

```bash
# Disable a registry (keeps config, excludes from searches)
sparkrun registry disable myteam

# Re-enable a disabled registry
sparkrun registry enable myteam
```

## Update registries

```bash
sparkrun registry update
```

Fetches the latest recipes from all enabled remote registries.

## List benchmark profiles

```bash
# List all available benchmark profiles across registries
sparkrun registry list-benchmark-profiles

# Show details of a specific benchmark profile
sparkrun registry show-benchmark-profile deepseek-r1-distill-671b
```

## Search across registries

```bash
sparkrun search qwen3
sparkrun recipe search llama
```

Searches by name, model, and description across all enabled registries.

## Creating a registry

A recipe registry is any git repository containing YAML files:

```
my-recipes/
├── recipes/
│   ├── my-model-vllm.yaml
│   ├── my-model-sglang.yaml
│   └── experimental-model.yaml
└── README.md
```

Each YAML file should follow the [recipe format](/recipes/format/). Anyone who adds your registry can use your recipes by name.

## Recipe discovery order

1. **Exact/relative file path** — if the argument is an existing file
2. **Bundled recipes** — shipped with sparkrun
3. **Registry paths** — from configured registries
4. **Registry stem matching** — searches by filename stem

Filenames are matched with or without `.yaml`/`.yml` extensions.
