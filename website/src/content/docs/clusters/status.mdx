title: Cluster Status
description: Check what inference workloads are running on your cluster.

## Check running workloads

```bash
sparkrun cluster status
sparkrun status              # alias
```

This shows all sparkrun containers running on your cluster hosts, grouped by job.

## Output

The status command displays:

- **Running jobs** — containers grouped by cluster ID with role (head/worker/solo), host, status, and container image
- **IP mapping** — when InfiniBand was detected during launch, shows the complementary IP alongside each host (e.g. management IP if you defined the cluster by IB IPs, or vice versa)
- **Idle hosts** — hosts that have no sparkrun containers running
- **Pending operations** — downloads or image distributions currently in progress that haven't launched containers yet, with elapsed time and a note that they will consume VRAM once launched
- **Copy-paste commands** — ready-to-use `sparkrun logs` and `sparkrun stop` commands for each running job

:::tip
The status output includes copy-paste-ready `logs` and `stop` commands for each running job.
:::

:::note
Pending operations are tracked via lightweight lock files. If a `sparkrun run` process is downloading a model or distributing a container image, it will appear in the pending operations section even though no container is running yet. This helps you account for upcoming VRAM usage when planning additional workloads.

## Options

```bash
# Check a specific cluster
sparkrun cluster status --cluster mylab

# Check specific hosts
sparkrun cluster status --hosts 192.168.11.13,192.168.11.14
```

If no options are given, uses the default cluster.
