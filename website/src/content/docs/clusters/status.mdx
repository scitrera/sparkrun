## Check running workloads

```bash
sparkrun cluster status
```

This shows all sparkrun containers running on your cluster hosts, grouped by job.

## Output

The status command displays:
- Containers grouped by job (with recipe name if cached)
- Container role (head/worker), host, status, and image
- Ready-to-use `sparkrun logs` and `sparkrun stop` commands for each job

## Options

```bash
# Check a specific cluster
sparkrun cluster status --cluster mylab

# Check specific hosts
sparkrun cluster status --hosts 192.168.11.13,192.168.11.14
```

If no options are given, uses the default cluster.

:::tip
The status output includes copy-paste-ready `logs` and `stop` commands for each running job.
