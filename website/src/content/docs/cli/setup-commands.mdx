## Install sparkrun

```bash
sparkrun setup install
```

Installs sparkrun as a managed uv tool with a shell alias and tab completion. This is the recommended installation method.

## Shell tab-completion

```bash
sparkrun setup completion              # auto-detects your shell
sparkrun setup completion --shell zsh  # specify shell explicitly
```

After restarting your shell, recipe names, cluster names, and subcommands all tab-complete.

:::note
If you installed via `sparkrun setup install`, tab completion is already configured.
:::

## Update sparkrun

```bash
sparkrun setup update
```

Updates sparkrun to the latest version in your managed environment.

## SSH mesh setup

```bash
sparkrun setup ssh [options]
```

Set up passwordless SSH across your cluster hosts. See the [SSH Setup](/getting-started/ssh-setup/) guide for full details.

|---|---|
| `--hosts` / `-H` | Comma-separated host list |
| `--cluster` | Use a saved cluster |
| `--user` | SSH user (default: current OS user) |
| `--extra-hosts` | Additional hosts beyond the cluster |
| `--no-include-self` | Exclude the control machine from the mesh |
