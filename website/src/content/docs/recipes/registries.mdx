description: Configure custom recipe registries for sharing and discovering recipes.
---

sparkrun searches bundled recipes first, then any custom registries you've configured. Registries are git repositories containing YAML recipe files.

## View configured registries

```bash
sparkrun recipe registries
```

## Add a registry

```bash
sparkrun recipe add-registry myteam \
  --url https://github.com/myorg/spark-recipes.git \
  --subpath recipes
```

The `--subpath` option specifies where recipe files live within the repository.

## Remove a registry

```bash
sparkrun recipe remove-registry myteam
```

## Update registries

```bash
sparkrun recipe update
```

Fetches the latest recipes from all remote registries.

## Search across registries

```bash
sparkrun search qwen3
sparkrun recipe search llama
```

Searches by name, model, and description across all registries.

## Creating a registry

A recipe registry is any git repository containing YAML files:

```
my-recipes/
├── recipes/
│   ├── my-model-vllm.yaml
│   ├── my-model-sglang.yaml
│   └── experimental-model.yaml
└── README.md
```

Each YAML file should follow the [recipe format](/recipes/format/). Anyone who adds your registry can use your recipes by name.

## Recipe discovery order

1. **Exact/relative file path** — if the argument is an existing file
2. **Bundled recipes** — shipped with sparkrun
3. **Registry paths** — from configured registries
4. **Registry stem matching** — searches by filename stem

Filenames are matched with or without `.yaml`/`.yml` extensions.
