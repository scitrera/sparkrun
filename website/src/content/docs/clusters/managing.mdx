## List all clusters

```bash
sparkrun cluster list
```

Shows all saved clusters with their hosts and whether they are the default.

## Show cluster details

```bash
sparkrun cluster show mylab
```

Displays the cluster's hosts, description, SSH user, and default status.

## Delete a cluster

```bash
sparkrun cluster delete mylab
```

Removes the cluster configuration. This does not affect running workloads.

## Default cluster

### Set a default

```bash
sparkrun cluster set-default mylab
```

### Show the current default

```bash
sparkrun cluster default
```

### Remove the default

```bash
sparkrun cluster unset-default
```

When a default cluster is set, workload commands (`run`, `stop`, `logs`, `status`) use it automatically unless `--hosts` or `--cluster` is specified.
