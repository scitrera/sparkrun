title: sparkrun stop
description: Stop a running inference workload.
---

```bash
sparkrun stop <recipe> [options]
```

Stop containers for a running inference workload across all hosts.

## Options

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--hosts` / `-H` | Comma-separated host list |
| `--hosts-file` | File with hosts |
| `--cluster` | Use a saved cluster by name |
| `--tp` / `--tensor-parallel` | Match host trimming from run |
| `--dry-run` / `-n` | Show what would be done |

## Examples

```bash
sparkrun stop qwen3-1.7b-vllm
sparkrun stop nemotron3-nano-30b-nvfp4-vllm --tp 2
sparkrun stop nemotron3-nano-30b-nvfp4-vllm --cluster mylab
```

:::caution
The `--hosts`/`--cluster`/`--tp` flags must match the original `run` command so sparkrun can find the right containers. If you launched with `--tp 2`, pass `--tp 2` to stop as well.
