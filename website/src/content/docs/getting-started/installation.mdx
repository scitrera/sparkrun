description: Install sparkrun on your system using uv or pip.

## Recommended: Install via uvx

The easiest way to install sparkrun is with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), the fast Python package manager:

```bash
# Install uv if you don't have it
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Install sparkrun (manages venv + shell alias + tab completion)
uvx sparkrun setup install
```

This creates a managed virtual environment, installs sparkrun, creates a shell-ready command, and sets up tab completion — all in one.

## Alternative: pip install

```bash
pip install sparkrun
# or
uv pip install sparkrun
```

With a manual pip install, you'll need to set up tab completion separately:

```bash
# NOTE: relies on the 'sparkrun' command being in your PATH
sparkrun setup completion
```

## Verify installation

```bash
sparkrun --version
```

## Updating

```bash
# NOTE: only works if you installed with the recommended installation methods
sparkrun setup update
```

This updates sparkrun to the latest version in your managed environment.

## Requirements

- Python 3.12+
- SSH access to one or more NVIDIA DGX Spark systems
- Docker installed on target hosts (SSH user must be in the `docker` group)
