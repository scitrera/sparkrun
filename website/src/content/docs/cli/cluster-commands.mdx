description: Create, manage, and configure named clusters.

Clusters are named groups of DGX Spark hosts. Save your hosts once and reference them by name in every command.

The first host in a cluster definition is used as the **head node** for multi-node jobs.

## Create a cluster

```bash
sparkrun cluster create <name> --hosts <ip1>,<ip2>,... [-d "description"] [--user <ssh_user>]
```

## Update a cluster

```bash
sparkrun cluster update <name> [--hosts <ip1>,<ip2>,...] [-d "description"] [--user <ssh_user>]
```

## List clusters

```bash
sparkrun cluster list
```

## Show cluster details

```bash
sparkrun cluster show <name>
```

## Delete a cluster

```bash
sparkrun cluster delete <name>
```

## Set/unset default cluster

```bash
sparkrun cluster set-default <name>
sparkrun cluster unset-default
sparkrun cluster default        # show current default
```

When a default cluster is set, commands like `sparkrun run` and `sparkrun stop` use it automatically without needing `--cluster` or `--hosts`.
